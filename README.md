## Dev Setup
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Clone this Repository
- Open a Terminal and execute  
    ```> docker-compose up -d```  
    Note: If you don't specify a compose file with the -f Argument, Docker will automatically use the docker-compose.override.yml (which I setup to use for Development). The docker-compose.yml File is used for Production!
